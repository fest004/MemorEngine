# MemorEngine is an engine being based off of Dave Churchills COMP4300 Introduction to Gamee Programming. I am following all the lectures and completing all the assignments, and will eventually end up with an engine that I can use for my own games. 

Check out the several other branches that show the completion of different assignments ranging from 1-4 given out by the course. Final Project will be its own Repo. 

*HOW TO USE**

*In progress* 




*DEPENDENCIES**

The game engine has the following dependencies:

SFML
spdlog

Make sure you have SFML and spdlog installed and working on your Linux system before attempting to compile. <

*END GOAL**
Working game engine for my needs that I can configure and change to my needs. 

2D arena topdown shooter with stages, minibosses and waves, with several scenes. Small story with dialouge. Will be a separate repo.
