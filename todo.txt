Main goal: 

Separate engine from sandbox/game. Currently integrated as one thing. Basically make it two entities compiled by their own. Simply
do:

#include <Memor>

and get access to the full api using namespaces. 

Finishing touches on engine:

Polish/finish renderables.
Add more physics, like collision resolution or mtv calculation. 


Add now features: 
Raycasting
More debugging options
Sound system
Rescale window
